        We are a team of movie lovers who believes no movie-watcher should have to struggle to find a great movie to watch. We agree that searching for films is frustrating, and inefficient. With a growing online selection of movie resources, how are we supposed to find movies to watch without searching through numerous websites?<br><br>

        As frustrated movie-finders, we envisioned a way to easily, and efficiently find popular movies personalized to our tastes. As excited developers, we found our inspiration for WHATCH: an application that combines our love of movies and the convenience of the internet to simplify the way we find great movies. WHATCH allows us to spend more time whatching and less time searching.<br><br>

        Our application combines the functionality of numerous online movie resources, such as IMDb and Amazon Instant Play, to ease the process of finding and selecting movies. WHATCH is efficient and fun&#8212; an  application of discovery and joy.<br><br>
